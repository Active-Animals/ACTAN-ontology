description: >-
  This pattern captures activities defined only by the bodily disposition they realize, such as 'positioning activity' realizing a 'bodily disposition', or 'swimming' realizing its 'positional mode'.

  Examples:
  - 'positioning activity': 'activity behaviour' that realizes the behavioural type of 'bodily disposition'
  - 'swimming': 'locomotion positioning' that realizes the aquatic type of 'positional mode'
