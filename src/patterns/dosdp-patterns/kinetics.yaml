description: >-
  This pattern captures kinetics activities, characterized by their physical qualities (such as momentum, friction, and pressure).

  Examples:
  - bouncing: kinetics activity that involves elasticity
  - levering: kinetics activity that involves 'decreased' force
  - pulling: thrust that involves tension
