description: >-
  This pattern captures locomotion and posture (i.e. positioning) activities, defined only by the positional mode they realize.

  Examples:
  - burrowing locomotion: locomotion positioning that realizes the 'fossorial' positional mode
  - swimming locomotion: locomotion positioning that realizes the 'aquatic' positional mode
