description: >-
  This pattern captures posture activities, defined by the positional modes that they realize, and the placement activities that are involved.

  Examples:
  - cantilever: posture that realizes the 'substratal' type of positional mode, with 'anchored' and 'tilted' placements
  - float: posture that realizes the 'aquatic' type of positional mode, with a 'tilted' placement
