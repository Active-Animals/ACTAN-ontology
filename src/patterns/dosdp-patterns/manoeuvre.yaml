description: >-
  This pattern captures manoeuvres, characterized by their physical qualities, but within limits (physical qualities concerning direction or 'movement quality').

  Examples:
  - turn: manoeuvre that has a direction and an angular velocity
  - yawing: manoeuvre that has a yaw quality
  - ascent: manoeuvre that has an up direction
