description: >-
  This pattern captures manoeuvres, characterized by their physical qualities, but within limits (physical qualities concerning direction or 'movement quality').

  Examples:
  - bending: movement that has a curved quality
  - jerking: movement that has a discontinuous quality
  - shrivelling: contracting that has a 'decreased area' quality
