description: >-
  This pattern captures locomotion and posture (i.e. positioning) activities, defined both by the positional mode they realize, and by the particular kinetic activities that are involved.

  Examples:
  - surface-creeping: traversing locomotion that realizes the 'substratal' type of supported mode, and uses 'creeping' kinetics
  - hanging posture: posture positioning that realizes the 'suspensory' type of positional mode, and uses 'gripping' kinetics
