pattern_name: posture_from_kinetics

pattern_iri: https://github.com/Active-Animals/Ontology/patterns/posture_from_kinetics

description: >-
  This pattern captures those postures which are defined both by the positional mode they realize, and by the particular kinetic activities that are involved.

  Examples:
  - hanging posture: posture positioning that realizes the 'suspensory' type of positional mode, and uses 'gripping' kinetics
